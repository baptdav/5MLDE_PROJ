### Project TODO List:

#### 1. Define Project Scope and Dataset:

- Choose a topic from the provided list or propose your own.
- Select a dataset relevant to the chosen topic.
- Clearly define the project goals and success criteria.

#### 2. Data Ingestion and Quality Checks:

- **Prefect Integration:**
  - Implement a Prefect Flow for data ingestion.
  - Define tasks for downloading and loading the dataset.
  - Include data quality checks using Great Expectations.
- **Great Expectations Integration:**
  - Set up data expectations for the ingested data.
  - Include checks for missing values, data types, and other relevant metrics.
- **Logging:**
  - Use Prefect to log information about the data ingestion process.

#### 3. Model Training:

- **MLflow Integration:**
  - Develop a Prefect Flow for model training.
  - Utilize MLflow for tracking experiments and logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
  - Train a machine learning model using the chosen dataset.
  - Save the trained model to the MLflow registry.

#### 4. Model Deployment:

- **Deployment Framework:**
  - Choose a deployment framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Docker).
  - Implement a Prefect Flow for model deployment.
- **Containerization:**
  - Dockerize your model and necessary dependencies.
  - Create Dockerfiles for building the images.
- **Deployment to Cloud:**
  - If applicable, deploy the Dockerized model to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

#### 5. Testing and Monitoring:

- **Locust Integration:**
  - Develop Locust scripts for load testing your deployed model.
  - Test the model under various load scenarios to ensure performance.
- **Great Expectations for Model Output:**
  - Set expectations for model output and predictions.
  - Implement checks to ensure the model is producing valid predictions.

#### 6. Documentation and Presentation:

- **Documentation:**
  - Provide documentation for the entire pipeline, including setup instructions and explanations of each step.
- **Presentation:**
  - Prepare a presentation summarizing your project.
  - Cover the chosen topic, dataset, pipeline architecture, and results.

#### 7. Additional Enhancements (Optional):

- **Automated Triggering:**
  - Implement automated triggers for the pipeline (e.g., using Prefect's scheduling capabilities).
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Enhance logging to include more detailed information about each step in the pipeline.
  - Set up monitoring for the deployed model.

#### 8. Final Review and Submission:

- **Code Review:**
  - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure clarity, consistency, and adherence to best practices.
- **Testing:**
  - Perform end-to-end testing of the entire pipeline.
- **Submission:**
  - Submit the project, including code, documentation, and the presentation.

#### 9. Iterative Improvement (Post-submission):

- Collect feedback from peers or instructors.
- Consider improvements or extensions to the project based on feedback.
